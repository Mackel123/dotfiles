Simple but featured. Focused on ergonomics, mnemonics and consistency.

Cherry pick the lines you need and totally understand.

Always a WIP üèó

# Key mappings

I assign the key mappings rationally aiming to make them efficient and easy to remember.

* Multiple leader keys

  In addition to `<Space>` that is the general leader key, `\` and `,` are set as the leader keys for toggling and LSP respectively.

* Mnemonic

  Key bindings are organized using mnemonic prefixes like `<Leader>b` for buffer, `<Leader>f` for fuzzy finder, `<Leader>w` for window, etc.

* Consistent

  Similar functionalities have the same key binding throughout my dotfiles. For example, `,` and `.` for moving tabs in both kitty and Neovim.
